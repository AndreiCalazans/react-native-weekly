 ## Implement mount hooks in UIManager [#37460](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/37460)

The change by Rub√©n Norte \<rubennorte@meta.com\> implements mount hooks in UIManager which notify when a root shadow tree has been mounted.

- [RCTScheduler.h](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/32bd60f863f/packages/react-native/React/Fabric/RCTScheduler.h#L70-L72)
The `reportMount:` method is added to `RCTScheduler` to report mounted surface IDs.

- [RCTScheduler.mm](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/32bd60f863f/packages/react-native/React/Fabric/RCTScheduler.mm#L135-L140) 
The `reportMount:` method calls through to the C++ scheduler to report the mounted surface ID.

- [RCTSurfacePresenter.mm](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/32bd60f863f/packages/react-native/React/Fabric/RCTSurfacePresenter.mm#L283-L285)
A check for the `react_fabric:enable_mount_hooks_ios` React Native config is added. If enabled, mount hooks will be used.

The change is meant for internal React Native use, not external libraries. It will be used to implement IntersectionObserver.
